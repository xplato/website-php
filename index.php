<h1 id="fancyboi" class="title">home</h1>
<p>I'm Tristan (or `athena` on Tilde and `xplato` on GitHub). This is my very minimal personal website. This is the place I write (when I don't write for <a href="https://infinium.earth" target="_blank">Infinium</a>).</p>
<p>You can <a href="./articles.php">see my writings</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Infinium8" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">some of my code</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hiring me or my company, contact me via my Tilde email address. If you're not on Tilde, contact us <a href="https://www.infinium.earth/contact" target="_blank">on our website.</a></p>
